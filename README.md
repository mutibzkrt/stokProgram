Project Name: C# Inventory Management System

Description:
This project is a comprehensive inventory management system developed using the C# programming language and Windows Form application development tools. Its main purpose is to enable users to easily manage and track their inventory. Below are some key features of the project:

User Authentication and Registration:
Users can log in to the application or create a new account to access its features. This ensures that each user can securely manage their own data.

Product Management:
Users can add new products, edit existing ones, or delete them. Specific attributes and stock quantities can be specified for each product.

Inventory Operations:
Users can perform stock entries and stock withdrawals. This allows them to track every change in the inventory.

Work Order Creation:
Users can create work orders and track details related to these orders. This can be used to manage the production or assembly processes of products.

QR Code Scanning:
Detailed information about products or semi-finished goods can be accessed by scanning the QR codes on them. This facilitates tracking and verification of products.

Tracking by Serial Number:
Each product or semi-finished good can be assigned a unique serial number, and through this serial number, users can view the history and other details of the products. Additionally, automatic processes for combining products withdraw the necessary materials from stock and add the new product to stock.

Usage of SQL Database:
SQL database is used for secure and effective data storage. This enhances data consistency and accessibility.

Purchase Management and Directory:
Users can record purchase transactions and manage supplier information. Additionally, the directory feature allows easy access to supplier details and other information.
